# Edit-Project

This Project is a simulation of a mobile APP that should always be viewed on mobile.
It was designed in the 360 Project from EDIT that has the collab  of marketing, project management, ux ui and frontend teams.
We had a brief from a client called Wells that wanted to solve some problems, so we came to the conclusion of designing a mobile app.
Since we only know frontend languages, we design it in html, css and javascript to simulate a mobile app.
The app is design in grids of 6 columns and can be seen in a width of 330 to 420 since most mobile varies in that range or even less.
It's already responsive but i pretend to design it myself so it can be used in tablet widths.
Another thing that I want to improve is implement a few javascript animations so I can practice what I learned in the course.
